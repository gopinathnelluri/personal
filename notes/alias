I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we have been encountering with System A. We have noticed that the record name in the system is changing randomly from time to time. This inconsistency is leading to failures and is currently outside the scope of our Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities.

At present, our team is required to manually validate the loans to identify such cases and fix the data to rerun the loans. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, which could potentially lead to further issues down the line.

To handle this issue more efficiently, we propose an enhancement to our RPA. Specifically, we suggest that the RPA should be upgraded to support multiple alias names for each record. This enhancement would allow the RPA to recognize and process the records correctly, even when the record name changes.

We believe that this enhancement will significantly improve our data processing capabilities, reduce manual intervention, and ultimately lead to more accurate and efficient operations.

We would appreciate your support in this matter and look forward to discussing the next steps. Please let us know if you need any further information or clarification regarding this request.
