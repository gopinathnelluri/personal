A dashboard showing real-time stats of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) executions can provide valuable insights for a business team, product owner, and development team. This can help with:

Business Team: Monitoring and tracking the performance of RPA solutions in real-time can help to ensure that they are meeting the desired business outcomes and goals, such as increased efficiency and cost savings.

Product Owner: A real-time dashboard can provide visibility into how RPA solutions are impacting the business and help with prioritizing improvements or future developments.

Development Team: A real-time dashboard can provide valuable insights into the performance of RPA solutions and help with identifying areas for improvement. This can lead to continuous improvement and optimization of the RPA solutions, resulting in better outcomes for the business.


If a dashboard showing real-time stats of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) executions is not available, the following problems may arise:

Lack of Visibility: The business team and product owners may not have immediate access to important information about the performance of RPA solutions, making it difficult to track progress and identify areas for improvement.

Increased Communication Overhead: Without a dashboard, the business team may need to reach out to developers to gather information, which can increase ad-hoc activities for developers and add additional workload to their daily tasks.

Inaccurate Data: Manual data gathering and sharing can result in inaccuracies and inconsistencies, as well as a delay in receiving updated information.

Inefficient Decision-Making: Without real-time information, decision-making can be slower and less informed, as important data may not be readily available.

Missed Opportunities: Without a real-time dashboard, opportunities for improvement and optimization may be missed, as the team may not have immediate access to the necessary information to identify and act on issues.
